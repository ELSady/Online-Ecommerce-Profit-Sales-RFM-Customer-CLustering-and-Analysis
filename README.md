## Data Dcience Project : Ecommerce Profit-Sales RFM Customer Clustering and Analysis Overview
* Dataset of one of Ecommerce sited in US with a customer's purchase history over the course year of 2015.
* Analyse which products / categories's as well as product segment which provide the most inerms of profit and sales.
* ANalyze and filter out which countries / regions which satisfies the 80% of sales / profit.
* Using Recency, Frequency and Monetary strategies to segment customers into certain groups based on the RFM scoring / metric.
* Build unsupervised K means model to further improve / confirm customer segmentation.

RFM analysis is a data driven customer behavior segmentation technique. RFM stands for recency, frequency, and monetary value. The idea is to segment customers based on when their last purchase was, how often they’ve purchased in the past, and how much they’ve spent overall. All three of these measures have proven to be effective predictors of a customer's willingness to engage in marketing messages and offers. While RFM analysis was born in direct-mail, it is a powerful tool for eCommerce stores to use today. RFM analysis allows us to make sense of all the customer data our store captures as part of interactions with the brand and customer transactions from the store. 


### Business QUestions:
* Which products / categories of product and segment generate the most of sales-profit?
* Which Cities, Stattes and Countries generate the most of sales and profit? 
* How are thecumulative sum of 80% of sales / profit for all parameters?
* How is the customer segmentation based on RFM analysis? 
* How is the behaviour / specific traits for each customer group?
